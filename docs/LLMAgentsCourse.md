LLM Agents course in UC Berkeley

[Video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yf-e-9FvOc&list=PLS01nW3RtgopsNLeM936V4TNSsvvVglLc)

Lecture 1 (LLM Reasoning)

- Nice lecture talks about need for intermediate steps in LLMs. Only listened to partially due to poor audio quality. Can revisit slides later.

Lecture 2 (LLM agents)

- Not that good, can revisit later.

Lecture 5 (Compound Systems)

- Good ideas presented, focus on Dspy. Speaker speaks too fast, making it hard to follow. But DSPy is a good thing to look into later.

Lecture 6 (Code Agents)

- Talks about code generation (copilot style systems) and Code agents like OpenHands.
- Good intro to the topic.
- OpenHands githb - https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands
