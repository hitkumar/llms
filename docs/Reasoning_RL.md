**Papers**
- Deepseek-R1: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12948
Very nice paper, distillation is a very neat idea.

TODOs
- [ ] Read https://www.interconnects.ai/p/papers-im-reading-base-model-rl-grpo with more details of other papers
- Do Deep RL course from UCB: https://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/ to understand more about policy gradients and other RL algorithms.
